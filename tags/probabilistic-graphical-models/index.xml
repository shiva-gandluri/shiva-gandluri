      <description>Built a Gamma-Poisson classifier to represent the similarity between records in disparate datasets. Our efforts showed impressive results, even better than the probabilistic approach proposed by Fellegi-Sunter. The prototype has now been launched as a stand-alone framework for entity resolution developed by the company, and I have also managed to submit a paper based on our research to AIStats. This classifier can work with streaming, sparse and sequential data</description>
