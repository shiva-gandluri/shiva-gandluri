      <description>In recent years, we have witnessed a significant progress in various fields of AI, such as computer vision, as well as language understanding. These progress motivated researchers to address a more challenging problem: question answering and question generation on visual data. This problem combines both image understanding as well as language understanding. Essentially, this task is defined as follows: an image along with a question about that image is the input to the AI system, and the intelligent system is supposed to output a correct answer to the question with respect the input image.</description>
