      <description>As a part of my Web Technologies Lab, I built a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering (CF). From past user activity (like/dislike or ratings), I built a rule-based model, that uses the neighborhood-based CF. This also allows a prediction from like-minded users with similar ratings. The MovieLens dataset was used and employed user interactions like ratings to drive the GRU.</description>
