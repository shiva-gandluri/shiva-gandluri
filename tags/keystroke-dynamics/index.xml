      <description>Made in the Smart India Hackathon for the Indian Space Research Organisation, my team built a web app that recorded keystrokes of a user to create a dataset capturing his/her typing style. The project used a C-RNN-GAN which would distinguish between a legitimate user and a malicious user based on his/her typing style based on trust metrics. The training parameters for each user will be unique, and thus a trust mechanism would reward or penalize based on correct or incorrect typing behavior, based on the RNN network.</description>
