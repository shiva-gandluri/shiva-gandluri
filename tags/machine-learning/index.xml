      <description>In recent years, we have witnessed a significant progress in various fields of AI, such as computer vision, as well as language understanding. These progress motivated researchers to address a more challenging problem: question answering and question generation on visual data. This problem combines both image understanding as well as language understanding. Essentially, this task is defined as follows: an image along with a question about that image is the input to the AI system, and the intelligent system is supposed to output a correct answer to the question with respect the input image.</description>

      <title>Smart Crop - A Farming Management System</title>

      <description>A project that provides information on crop sustenance based on geo-location, rainfall. land-surface temperature and soil nutrient analysis. It is a one-stop shop for farmers to learn about air, water soil conditions in and around their farm, receive alerts about any possible disasters/weather alerts and get recommendations about crop cultivation. The data required for this forecasting system would be taken from varied sources such as ISRO MOSDAC, ISRO Vedas, each having different characteristics.</description>

      <title>Crop Recommendation System</title>

      <description>In this hackathon, sponsored by the Indian Space Research Organization, we built a recommendation system for farmers to provide actionable advice on the crops that would be ideal based on the location, rainfall and soil time-series data. The data required for this forecasting system would be taken from varied sources such as ISRO MOSDAC, ISRO Vedas, each having different characteristics. Designing a system that would take into account the various parameters gave an insight into topics like multivariate time-series systems.</description>
