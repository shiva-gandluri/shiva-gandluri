      <description>Made under the guidance of my college professor Prof. Lakshmi Kurup, the application strives to teach basic grammar, specifically comma punctuation to small children. Using a list of subjects, objects, and verbs, the web app can construct a sentence and check user input at each stage using Context Free Grammar. Hints are produced based on the input entered by the user, so as to guide the user better.</description>

      <title>Smart Crop - A Farming Management System</title>

      <guid>https://shahsaumya.github.io/projects/creations/smart_crop/</guid>
      <description>A project that provides information on crop sustenance based on geo-location, rainfall. land-surface temperature and soil nutrient analysis. It is a one-stop shop for farmers to learn about air, water soil conditions in and around their farm, receive alerts about any possible disasters/weather alerts and get recommendations about crop cultivation. The data required for this forecasting system would be taken from varied sources such as ISRO MOSDAC, ISRO Vedas, each having different characteristics.</description>

      <description>In this hackathon, sponsored by the Indian Space Research Organization, we built a recommendation system for farmers to provide actionable advice on the crops that would be ideal based on the location, rainfall and soil time-series data. The data required for this forecasting system would be taken from varied sources such as ISRO MOSDAC, ISRO Vedas, each having different characteristics. Designing a system that would take into account the various parameters gave an insight into topics like multivariate time-series systems.</description>

      <description>As a part of my Web Technologies Lab, I built a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering (CF). From past user activity (like/dislike or ratings), I built a rule-based model, that uses the neighborhood-based CF. This also allows a prediction from like-minded users with similar ratings. The MovieLens dataset was used and employed user interactions like ratings to drive the GRU.</description>

      <description>Made in the Smart India Hackathon for the Indian Space Research Organisation, my team built a web app that recorded keystrokes of a user to create a dataset capturing his/her typing style. The project used a C-RNN-GAN which would distinguish between a legitimate user and a malicious user based on his/her typing style based on trust metrics. The training parameters for each user will be unique, and thus a trust mechanism would reward or penalize based on correct or incorrect typing behavior, based on the RNN network.</description>

      <description>A forum web app for the entire college as a member of the Technical Co-Committee in DJ Literary Society. The forum made use of different categories for the different departments and threads in each of these categories. It is built using the Misago framework built on top of Django.</description>
