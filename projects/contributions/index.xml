      <description>I wanted to work on projects that would benefit society and found Google Summer of Code (GSoC) to be the perfect opportunity. I worked with Free UK Genealogy, an organization that aims at the transcription of family data and explored Named Entity Recognition (NER) more deeply. I created an end-to-end framework that extracts text from wills, using OCR, and seeds them into a database with named entities. A big constraint in the project was a lack of adequate training samples to build an accurate NER model.</description>
