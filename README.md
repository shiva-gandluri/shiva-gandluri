## About Me

I'm a Software Development Engineer at AWS, building resilient, high-scale cloud infrastructure and developer tools. With a Master's in Data Science from SUNY Buffalo and a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering, I bridge the gap between robust software engineering and intelligent data systems.

My expertise spans **full-stack development**, **cloud architecture**, and **machine learning**, with a passion for creating intuitive solutions that solve complex real-world problems.
